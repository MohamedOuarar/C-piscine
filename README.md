# C piscine
The C Piscine is an intense, month-long bootcamp for students applying to the 1337 school, part of the 42 Network. It’s designed to teach the basics of programming in C, a language known for working close to the computer’s memory, so students can understand how things actually work inside a computer. During the Piscine, students learn about basic programming concepts like data types, loops, conditionals, and arrays, as well as more complex topics like pointers, memory allocation, and command-line arguments.

The Piscine is packed with projects and exercises that help students develop problem-solving skills. Every day, they complete coding challenges that require them to think carefully and solve problems step by step. These projects also help them practice debugging—finding and fixing errors in code.

Collaboration is a big part of the Piscine. Students work together and give each other feedback, which helps them improve their skills and learn to communicate their ideas. By the end of the Piscine, students who succeed have built a strong foundation in programming and are ready for the more advanced projects that follow in the 42 curriculum.
